So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200.0. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8."
